"Use rx start to submit a packet buffer to the DMA engine, and\n" \
"then use rx poll to check for incoming packets. Once a packet\n" \
"has been received, rx start must be called again to re-submit\n" \
"the packet buffer. For convenience, calling rx with no arguments\n" \
"will do a poll, and if a packet was received, the packet buffer\n" \
"will be re-submitted automatically. The rx drain command will\n" \
"repeat this process until all packets have been drained from\n" \
"the CPU receive buffer."
