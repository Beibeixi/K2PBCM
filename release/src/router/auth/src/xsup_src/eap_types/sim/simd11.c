 * EAP-SIM fixes.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2004/01/13 01:55:56  chessing
 *
 * Major changes to EAP related code.  We no longer pass in an interface_data struct to EAP handlers.  Instead, we hand in a generic_eap_data struct which containsnon-interface specific information.  This will allow EAP types to be reused as phase 2 type easier.  However, this new code may create issues with EAP types that make use of the identity in the eap type.  Somehow, the identity value needs to propigate down to the EAP method.  It currently does not.  This should be any easy fix, but more testing will be needed.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  2003/11/24 04:56:04  chessing
 *
 * EAP-SIM draft 11 now works.  Statemachine updated to work based on the up/down state of an interface, rather than just assuming it is up.
