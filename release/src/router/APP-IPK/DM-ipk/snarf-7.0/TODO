* Fix memory leaks. Not critical but sloppy and embarrassing.

* Add an interactive shell-like interface. Type in urls, it downloads
  them. Should be handy for piping ("echo url | snarf") and
  others. Use your imagination.

* Maybe add an RC file.

* remove dependance on vfprintf.

* Port to win32 (make more portable in general)

* SSL borrowed from curl

* better browser-style URL guessing

* Improve password handling; cache username/hostname pairs and re-use 
  passwords. Don't prompt if the password is cached.

* Use keepalive for http and re-use sessions for ftp if grabbing multiple
  files from the same host.

* Add more & nicer output to progress code, most requested: ETA

* Fix non-ansi stuff. Automake seems to be screwing up its invocation
  of ansi2knr. I don't know why, yet, so stick with ANSI compilers if
  possible.
