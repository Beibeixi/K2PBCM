Here's a list of URLs to try to download, as sort of a test suite.

1. ftp://cs-pub.bu.edu/

This site fails on the PASV command, so it's handy to test the PORT fallback
stuff.

2. ftp://koobera.math.uic.edu/

This uses anonftpd on what I think is a VMS host. It doesn't ask for a
password, it just gives a 230 reply straight away. It does not support
REST (ftp resume) either. An all-together wacked-out server.
