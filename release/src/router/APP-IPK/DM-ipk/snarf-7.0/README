==================
snarf version 2.0
October 1, 1998
==================

Description
-----------
     Snarf is a utility I wrote to retrieve documents via the http and
ftp protocols. It supports http redirect, http and ftp resume, http
and ftp authentication, and other neat things.

Usage
-----
     To use snarf to download a file from an url, type 
"snarf <your url>". This will transfer the file from the remote
location to your computer. You can have as many URLs on the command
line as you want: "snarf <URL> <URL> <URL>" will download three
files. By default, it saves the file with the same name it had on the
remote system; if you want to change this, you can do 
"snarf <URL> <filename>" and it will save your URL to the filename you 
provide.

     To use the HTTP proxy feature, set the SNARF_PROXY, HTTP_PROXY,
or FTP_PROXY environment variables to the address of your proxy, such
as "proxy.mycompany.de:1080".

     If you run snarf without any arguments, it prints some usage
information.

Notes
-----
     I wrote this in three days four years ago and it was majorly
klugy, but it worked, and pretty niftily. I rewrote it from scratch
over the past few days and I'm pleased to say that it's much nicer and 
cleaner inside, and this cleanliness has made it easy to add some
features I always wanted to add to the old version.

Version 2.0.3:

     This version has a configure option of
"--with-guess-winsize". This feature uses ioctl to determine what your
operating system things the width of your terminal is. It's not
enabled by default, because I don't know how well it works on all
platforms. It's safe to enable on Linux and Solaris. If you manage to
get it to work somewhere else, let me know.
