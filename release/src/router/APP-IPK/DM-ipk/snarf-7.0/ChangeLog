2000-08-08  Zach Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* Made 7.0 release.

	* Fixed 3 longstanding annoying bugs:
	  - HTTP redirects were mistakenly converted to lowercase, causing
	    confusing 404s
	  - HTTP redirects were always treated as new HTTP URLs, when it's
	    legal to redirect to a FTP URL.
	  - snarf sent extra stuff between REST and RETR for FTP, which
	    confused some servers (Thanks to Steinar Gunderson for
	    annoying me into fixing this bug).

	Snarf still does not handle relative redirecton.

2000-01-17  Zach Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* Made 2.0.9 release.

	* util.c (dump_data): After dumping the data (or encountering an
	error), close the socket. This will need to change when we do
	HTTP/1.1 and keepalive, but for now it can behave this way.

	This fixed a bug where finished transfers would just hang waiting
	for "226 Transfer Complete" from the server in an ftp session.

1999-07-28  Zachary Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Added snarf.spec. Now rpm -ta
	snarf-m.n.tar.gz will work.

	* Made 2.0.8 release.

	* http.c (http_transfer): Fixed stupid bug I introduced by fixing
	a previous stupid bug. If you had transferred over half the file,
	resuming download would mistakenly tell you you already had all of
	it. 

1999-07-27  Zachary Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* Made 2.0.7 release.

	* Added '--help' flag and changed usage printing.
	
	* http.c (http_transfer): Fixed puzzling problem with http-resume
	that didn't detect properly that we had the whole file.

	* util.c (progress_init): Add rsrc to the progress struct, so we
	can print the whole progress line every time with the magic of
	\r. Now features continuous kb/sec meter!

	* ftp.c (ftp_transfer): Used the top-secret (to me, anyway) FTP
	"SIZE" command. This fixed a bug in determining the file's size
	when resuming.

1999-06-09  Zachary Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* util.c (progress_update): The things you learn when you try
	extreme cases. Large files would overflow an int in
	progress_update, causing it to spew hashes like mad. Changed to
	unsigned long int, problem fixed.

	* snarf.c (main): Added check for lone '--version' option.

1999-06-08  Zachary Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* Made 2.0.6 release.

	* http.c (http_transfer): Fixed stupid segfault caused when the
	server doesn't return a header.

	* util.c (dump_data): Changed progress bars so they also resume,
	instead of starting from the beginning every time.

	* http.c (get_request): Added referer spoofing (uses the value
	from the SNARF_HTTP_REFERER environment variable).

1998-11-16  Zachary Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* Made 2.0.5 release.

	* http.c (http_transfer): prompt for proxy password if not
	specified.

	* Added patch from Elrond to do proper conditional inclusion of
	herror.c. Elrond is very, very smart.

	* Converted warn, error, etc. into one function. Removed all debug
	printing.

	* snarf.c (main): Greatly simplified main arg processing
	loop. Also did some general cleanup.

1998-11-12  Zachary Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* Made 2.0.4 rerelease, only change being the included
	herror.c. I'm a bad boy for not bumping the version number.

	* Makefile.am: Fixed a problem with herror.c not going into the
	dist tarball.

1998-11-10  Zachary Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* Made 2.0.4 release.

	* http.c (get_request): Figured in for proxy passwords.

	* url.c (get_password): Fixed a problem with raw url strings
	without slashes.
	(get_username): Ditto.

1998-11-04  Zachary Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* http.c (http_transfer): Correctly set the size of the file to be
	transfered, thus fixing dump_data's inability to recognize when we
	had all of a HTTP-transferred file.

	* util.c (progress_update): Moved redrawing of the right-bracket
	so it only updates when a has is printed.

1998-10-20  Zachary Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* snarf-2.prj: Fixed a potential FPE problem if the transfer time
	is 0 seconds. Only affected alphas.

1998-10-19  Zachary Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* Made 2.0.3 release

	* util.c (dump_data): Fixed no-resume not getting honored. Also
	fixed http resume bug that caused failure when less than half the
	file was getting re-transmitted.

	* Progress bars are a little nicer now, with stderr buffered.

1998-10-18  Zachary Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* snarf-2.prj: Fixed some progress code.

1998-10-17  Zachary Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* snarf-2.prj: Added tests for strerror for SunOS 4.1.3

1998-10-16  Zachary Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* More testing. Sorry for this junky changelog!

	* Converted to use PRCS instead of CVS, testing.

1998-10-15  Zachary Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* Fixed a problem that would show up if you had more than 10 HTTP
	urls on the command line (bad redirect-loop catching logic).

	* Added John Bley's agent patches. Now you can pretend to be using 
	some other strange browser.

	* Caused errors to make snarf return nonzero.

	
1998-10-12  Zachary Beane  <xach@mint.net>

	* Made HTTP header matching case-insensitive.

	* Fixed progress bar FPE on small documents, with help from
	Elrond.

	* Changed progress initialization so that there are more cases
	where progress bars aren't printed. Also added -p option to force
	progress bar printing.

	* Added LATEST: "snarf LATEST" always downloads the latest version 
	of snarf from www.xach.com.

	* Added jlbec's dynamic socks5 linking patch.
