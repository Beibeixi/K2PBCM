Installing snarf
----------------
     First of all, run "./configure". This will build a Makefile for
you.

     If you are root, just type "make". If it compiles without
any errors, type "make install". 

     As I don't think I use any terribly system-specific stuff, it
should be able to compile on just about anything.


In case of trouble...
---------------------
     Send email to me (xach@mint.net) describing the type of system
you are on and the error message you are getting.
