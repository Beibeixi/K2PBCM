The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The authentication is based on Suite B with <b>128 bit</b> security based on <b>X.509 ECDSA</b>
certificates, <b>ECP Diffie-Hellman</b> groups and <b>AES-GCM</b> authenticated encryption.
The <b>kernel-libipsec</b> plugin is used for userland IPsec AES-GCM authenticated ESP
encryption.
<p/>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnel, an updown script automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the traffic tunneled via the <b>ipsec0</b>
tun interface. In order to test both tunnel and firewall, <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping
the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
