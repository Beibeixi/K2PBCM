Roadwarrior <b>carol</b> proposes to gateway <b>moon</b> the cipher suite
<b>AES_GCM_16_256</b> both for IKE and ESP by defining <b>ike=aes256gcm16-aesxcbc-modp2048</b>
(or alternatively <b>aes256gcm128</b>) and <b>esp=aes256gcm16-modp2048</b> in ipsec.conf,
respectively.
A ping from <b>carol</b> to <b>alice</b> successfully checks the established tunnel.
