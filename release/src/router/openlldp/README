The OpenLLDP software is currently in the very early stages.  As such,
please bear with us while we continue to improve the software.

Your best bet for getting up and running is the standard: ./configure;
make, and optionally "make install".  

The build process will create an executable called "lldpd" which you
can run directly from the src directory, or from your --prefix
directory, or from the default /usr/local/sbin/lldpd.  You will likely
want to run lldpd with the "-d A" flag, which turns on excessive
debugging, as we do not currently have an elegant solution for
displaying neighbor data in linux.

Enjoy!
